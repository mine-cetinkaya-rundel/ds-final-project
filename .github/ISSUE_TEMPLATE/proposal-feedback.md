Dear @ team : Below is the score breakdown for your proposal. Details of things that should be updated / revised are provided in separate issues. As you address them, you should close the individual issues. 

You can do this in one of two ways: on GitHub by clicking on Close issue or via a commit that directly addresses the issue. We’ll practice the second one. If you preface your commits with “Fixes”, “Fixed”, “Fix”, “Closes”, “Closed”, or “Close”, the issue will be closed when you push the changes to your repo. For example, suppose you want to close issue #2 which suggested that you add a new line to the README, your commit message can say something like `Add a new line to the README, closes #2`.

If you would like to resubmit your proposal for re-assessment (this is optional), comment on this issue letting me know when you're done with your updates. Deadline is <INSERT DEADLINE>. If you submit a re-proposal, your final score for the proposal will be the average of two scores you receive (first and second submission).
